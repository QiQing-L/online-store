# ðŸ›’ Online Store Application

## Description of the Project

This Java Console-Based Online Store is a simple command-line application that lets users browse products, add or remove items from their cart, and complete purchases using cash payment. After checkout, the program generates a timestamped sales receipt saved in a Receipts folder.

Designed for beginners and students, this project simulates the basic shopping experience in an easy-to-use, text-based format.

### Features

View all available products with IDs, names, and prices

Add or remove products from the shopping cart

Calculate total cost and handle cash payments

Display and save a detailed sales receipt

Automatically create a Receipts folder if it doesnâ€™t exist

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a customer, I want to see a list of main menu options when I open the store so that I can easily navigate to view products, view my cart, or exit the store.
- As a customer, I want to see a list of all available products so that I can decide which items I might want to buy.
- As a customer, I want to search for a product by entering its SKU so that I can quickly find and view details about a specific product.
- s a customer, I want to add a product to my shopping cart so that I can purchase it later during checkout.
- As a customer, I want to view all items currently in my shopping cart so that I can review what I plan to purchase and see the total cost.
- As a customer, I want to checkout and pay for my items so that I can complete my purchase.
- As a customer, I want to remove an item from my cart so that I can adjust my purchase before checkout.
- As a customer, I want a copy of my receipt saved as a file so that I can keep a record of my purchase.

## Interesting Piece of Code

File folder = new File("Receipts");
if (!folder.exists()) folder.mkdir();

DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyyMMddHHmmss");
String timestamp = LocalDateTime.now().format(formatter);
File receiptFile = new File(folder, timestamp + ".txt");

FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(receiptFile);
writer.write(receipt.toString());
writer.close()

Why Itâ€™s Interesting:
It automatically creates a Receipts folder (if it doesnâ€™t exist) and saves each customerâ€™s receipt with a unique timestamped filename, ensuring no two receipts overwrite each other.

## Future Work

Outline potential future enhancements or functionalities you might consider adding:

- Additional feature to be developed:
  - When a customer adds multiple items to a cart
    - Instead of showing the item multiple times, your
    cart should only display each item once, but
    display the quantity for each item
  
- Improvement of current functionalities.
